# Analyse-NYSE-data
In this project I analyze real life data from the New York Stock Exchange. 
A large dataset provided by Kaggle that contains historical financial data from S&P 500 companies.
I have created a smaller subset of the data that you will be using for the project.
In this project, I will go through the process of calculating summary statistics, drawing any inference from the statistics, calculating business metrics, and using models to forecast future growth prospects for the companies.
The goal is to perform an analysis and also create visual tools to communicate the results in informative ways.
